REACT_1 NOTE: This is all JavaScript! And remember, that’s what React is. We are calling built in React methods and functions.


Some of the code above is React-specific, including:


React.createClass – creates component classes

ReactDOM.render() – used to render a React Component or Components

React.createFactory – a function that generates a factory (object that can create other objects)

There is also some vanilla JavaScript code we used within this, including:


? – a conditional operator that checks for whether or not a condition is true, the : following it is shorthand for “else”

% – finds the remainder

setInterval() – a method that evaluates an expression at specified intervals (milliseconds)

Using the above React code, we created a timer that counts upward.

REACT_2 NOTE:


A constructor creates an object within a class

“Props” is short for properties

“Super” calls a constructor

“setstate” schedules a UI update
